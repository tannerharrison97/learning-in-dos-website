        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          We're a family based in [your area] who decided to raise our kids speaking Spanish—even though neither of us are native speakers. It started as an experiment and turned into a passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know firsthand how challenging (and rewarding!) it can be to create a bilingual environment when Spanish isn't your first language. That's why we started Learning in Dos: to share what we've learned and connect with other families on the same journey.
