# ¡Bienvenidos!

Welcome to Learning in Dos! We're so excited to finally launch this blog and share our bilingual parenting journey with you.

## Why "Learning in Dos"?

The name is a little play on words. "Dos" means "two" in Spanish, and it represents:

- **Two languages** – English and Spanish
- **Two parents** – both of us learning alongside our kids
- **Two perspectives** – we're not native speakers, and that's okay!

## What to Expect

We'll be sharing:

- **Real stories** from our daily life trying to speak Spanish at home
- **Tips and tricks** that have actually worked for us
- **Resources** we've found helpful (books, apps, songs, shows)
- **Honest reflections** on the challenges and wins

## Our Philosophy

We believe you don't have to be a native speaker to raise bilingual kids. Is our Spanish perfect? Definitely not. But we're committed to learning alongside our children, and we've found that consistency matters more than perfection.

> "El que no arriesga, no gana." (Nothing ventured, nothing gained.)

## Join Us!

We'd love to connect with other families on this journey. Whether you're just starting out or years into your bilingual adventure, there's room for everyone here.

Stay tuned for more posts, and don't hesitate to reach out!

¡Hasta pronto! 👋
